Diabetes Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning
Overview
Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects how the body processes blood sugar (glucose). Early detection is crucial to prevent severe health complications. This project uses Machine Learning techniques to predict whether a person has diabetes based on medical parameters such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, and more.

Dataset
The dataset used is from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
It contains medical records of female patients at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
Features include Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, and Age.
Features & Functionality
✅ Data Preprocessing – Cleaning, handling missing values, and normalizing data for better model performance.
✅ Feature Selection – Identifying the most significant features affecting diabetes prediction.
✅ Model Training – Multiple Machine Learning models trained and compared for performance.
✅ Performance Evaluation – Using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix, and ROC-AUC.
✅ User Input & Prediction – The final model predicts diabetes based on user-provided medical details.
